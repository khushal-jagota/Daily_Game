# Project Summary: Phase 5 Block (Virtual Keyboard & Core Refinements)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Phase Covered:** 5 (Virtual Keyboard Implementation, `CrosswordGrid` Refactor Analysis/Fixes, Layout/Styling Adjustments)

## 1. Introduction / Overall Goal

This document summarizes the development work undertaken in Phase 5. The primary goals were to:

1.  Implement a virtual on-screen keyboard as the primary input method, especially for touch devices, improving core game usability.
2.  Integrate the keyboard seamlessly with the existing state management (`useGameStateManager`) and focus system (hidden input element).
3.  Style the keyboard consistently with the application's theme.
4.  Address emergent layout, scaling, and rendering issues discovered during development, including a significant refactoring of the core `CrosswordGrid` component that occurred just prior to or during this phase.
5.  Refine core interaction logic (specifically Backspace behavior) for better user experience.

## 2. Key Features & Fixes Implemented

*   **Virtual Keyboard Integration:** Successfully integrated the `react-simple-keyboard` library.
*   **Keyboard Layout:** Configured the keyboard to display standard QWERTY letter keys, Backspace, and Enter (Enter currently non-functional).
*   **Input Handling:** Connected virtual key presses (`onKeyPress`) to `useGameStateManager` actions:
    *   Letters trigger `handleGuessInput`, passing the character and current timer stage.
    *   Backspace triggers `handleBackspace`.
    *   Enter key press is captured but currently performs no action.
*   **Focus Management (Callback Ref):** Implemented a **callback ref** pattern (`onInputRefChange` prop) passed from `App.tsx` down to `CrosswordGrid` to get a direct reference to the hidden input element. Focus is now programmatically returned to this input via `inputElement.focus()` within `App.tsx`'s `handleVirtualKeyPress` function (using `setTimeout`) after state updates, ensuring smoother transitions between virtual and physical keyboard input (though a known virtual->physical edge case remains). The previous focus mechanism relying on `useImperativeHandle` and `registerFocusHandler` was removed.
*   **Backspace Logic Refinement:** Modified `handleBackspace` in `useGameStateManager`:
    *   If the current cell has content and is editable, only the content is cleared (focus remains).
    *   If the current cell is empty, it searches backward, skipping unused/locked cells, clears the first editable cell found, and moves focus there.
*   **Styling & Theming:**
    *   Applied custom styling to the keyboard using `createGlobalStyle` (`KeyboardGlobalStyles.ts`) targeting library classes and leveraging theme variables (`crosswordTheme`).
    *   Implemented a **dark theme** for the keyboard and grid background, adjusting text/border/focus/highlight colors for contrast.
    *   Refined keyboard layout spacing (padding, gaps) for a tighter appearance.
    *   Fixed "sticky hover" effect on mobile by neutralizing the `:hover` background style.
*   **Layout & Scaling Fixes:**
    *   Resolved vertical viewport scrolling issue by adjusting `CrosswordWrapper` flex properties (`flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: auto`) and ensuring `max-height: 100%` was respected within the `CrosswordArea` (`1fr` row) flex container.
    *   Ensured the crossword grid scales down correctly on vertically constrained viewports.
*   **`CrosswordGrid` Refactor Fixes:** Addressed issues arising from a major refactor of `CrosswordGrid` (which moved to a CSS/SVG coordinate system approach):
    *   Restored `onClick` handling to allow cell selection.
    *   Corrected guess display logic to show `cellData.guess`.
    *   Implemented dynamic cell background/text color based on completion status and focus/highlight state within the new rendering structure.
    *   Fixed mobile SVG text positioning for clue numbers using `dy` attribute.

## 3. Key Architectural Changes & Refinements

*   **Input Ref Strategy:** Shifted from `forwardRef` / `useImperativeHandle` for focus control to a **callback ref prop** (`onInputRefChange`) passed from `App.tsx` to `CrosswordGrid` for direct access to the hidden input element. Centralized the explicit focus call within the `handleVirtualKeyPress` handler in `App.tsx`.
*   **State Management (`useGameStateManager`):** Modified `handleBackspace` logic significantly for improved UX. Ensured `handleGuessInput` received stage information.
*   **Styling Approach (Keyboard):** Adopted `createGlobalStyle` targeting library classes (`.hg-theme-default`, `.hg-button`, etc.) leveraging theme variables, rather than using the library's `buttonTheme` prop. Implemented dark theme via theme object modification.
*   **Core Rendering (`CrosswordGrid`):** Adapted to and fixed issues within the heavily refactored `CrosswordGrid` component, ensuring its new CSS/SVG rendering approach was correctly connected to application state and interaction handlers.

## 4. Final State (Post-Phase 5)

*   The application features a functional, styled on-screen virtual keyboard integrated into the layout.
*   Users can interact with the crossword grid using either the virtual or physical keyboard.
*   Focus management ensures focus returns to the grid after virtual key presses (with one documented edge case for virtual->physical transition).
*   Backspace behavior is more intuitive.
*   The application layout is stable, confined to the viewport without scrolling, and the crossword grid scales correctly.
*   The grid and keyboard adhere to the implemented dark theme.
*   Visual rendering issues (mobile number positioning, guess display, focus/highlight/completion styling) related to the `CrosswordGrid` refactor are resolved.

## 5. Key Decisions & Learnings

*   **Ref Strategy Pivot:** Recognizing the limitations of `forwardRef` through components rendering children and the complexity of the existing imperative handle, pivoting to the callback ref prop provided a cleaner solution for the required top-level focus control.
*   **Refactoring Impact:** Integrating a feature alongside/after a major refactoring of a core component (`CrosswordGrid`) required careful diagnosis to fix broken connections (event handlers, data binding) that weren't immediately obvious.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Solving the layout/scaling and Backspace behavior required several iterations and deeper analysis beyond the initial plan. Addressing emergent bugs (mobile text rendering, sticky hover) was necessary.
*   **Scoped Testing:** Breaking down the handler implementation (Step 5.12) into smaller logical units aided development and testing.
*   **Pragmatic Bug Deferral:** Acknowledged and documented a low-impact focus edge case (virtual->physical transition) rather than letting it block progress, accepting the need for careful monitoring.
*   **Styling Strategy:** Using `createGlobalStyle` worked but highlighted the trade-off between ease of overriding defaults vs. robustness against library class name changes (compared to using `buttonTheme`).

## 6. Next Steps

With the virtual keyboard implemented and critical layout/rendering issues resolved, the project is now ready to proceed with the previously deferred **Phase 6: Share Feature (Canvas PNG)**.
