# Project Summary: Phase 6 Block (Share Feature - Modal, Canvas, Share/Copy APIs)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Phase Covered:** 6 (Result Modal, Canvas PNG Generation, Web Share API, Clipboard API)

## 1. Introduction / Overall Goal

This document summarizes the development work undertaken in Phase 6. The primary goal was to implement a mechanism for users to view, share, and copy a visual summary of their completed game result. This involved:

1.  Automatically displaying a modal window upon game completion.
2.  Generating a PNG image representation of the result (time, puzzle info, colored grid without letters) client-side using the HTML Canvas API.
3.  Displaying this generated image as a preview within the modal.
4.  Providing functional "Share" and "Copy Image" buttons utilizing the Web Share API and Async Clipboard API respectively.
5.  Ensuring the feature integrates correctly with the existing game state and UI flow.

## 2. Key Features & Fixes Implemented

*   **Result Modal (`ResultModal.tsx`):**
    *   Created a new modal component using `styled-components`.
    *   Modal automatically opens upon game completion (triggered via state change in `App.tsx`).
    *   Displays loading state while generating the image, error messages on failure, and the final PNG preview using an `<img>` tag with an Object URL source.
    *   Includes "Share" and "Copy Image" buttons with appropriate disabled states.
    *   Handles closing via button or backdrop click.
    *   Manages Object URL lifecycle (creation and revocation) to prevent memory leaks using `useRef`.
    *   Resolved `useEffect` infinite loop related to state dependencies.
    *   Fixed `$isOpen` transient prop warning for styled-component.
*   **Canvas Rendering (`canvasRenderer.ts`):**
    *   Implemented `drawResultToCanvas` function to generate the result PNG.
    *   Handles DPR scaling for high-resolution output.
    *   Draws content according to Layout v4 specification:
        *   Time (top-right, colored based on final game stage).
        *   Info Line (centered below time: "Name #Number - Theme", uses placeholders).
        *   Colored Grid (main area, no letters, borders).
    *   Cell coloring uses the "Latest Stage" priority logic for intersections (fixed key lookup bug).
    *   Handles all completion stages (1-5) for coloring (fixed missing cases).
    *   Fixed critical bug where canvas dimensions were incorrectly set to `0x0` by removing `getBoundingClientRect` usage for offscreen canvas.
    *   Returns the final canvas content as a `Promise<Blob | null>`.
*   **App Integration (`App.tsx`):**
    *   Added state (`isResultModalOpen`) to control modal visibility.
    *   Implemented `useEffect` hook with `useRef` to detect the *transition* to game completion, ensuring the modal opens only once automatically.
    *   Memoized (`useMemo`) the `canvasData` prop passed to the modal to prevent unnecessary re-renders/effect triggers.
*   **Share Functionality (`handleShare` in `ResultModal`):**
    *   Uses `navigator.share` API.
    *   Checks API availability.
    *   Creates `File` object from the generated `imageBlob`.
    *   Uses `navigator.canShare({ files: [...] })` to detect file sharing support.
    *   Provides text-only share fallback if file sharing is not supported.
    *   Handles `AbortError` (user cancellation) gracefully.
    *   Provides success/error feedback.
*   **Copy Functionality (`handleCopy` in `ResultModal`):**
    *   Replaced the planned "Download" feature.
    *   Uses `navigator.clipboard.write()` with `new ClipboardItem({...})`.
    *   Checks API availability.
    *   Copies the `imageBlob` to the clipboard.
    *   Provides success/error feedback.

## 3. Key Architectural Changes & Refinements

*   **Client-Side Image Generation:** Introduced Canvas API usage for dynamically generating result summaries.
*   **Blob/Object URLs:** Utilized Blobs and Object URLs for handling binary image data and displaying previews efficiently.
*   **Modal Flow:** Added a modal confirmation/preview step to the post-game flow.
*   **Browser API Integration:** Leveraged Web Share API and Async Clipboard API for native sharing/copying capabilities.
*   **State Management:** Shifted modal visibility control to `App.tsx`; image generation state managed within `ResultModal`. Utilized `useRef` for transition detection in `App.tsx` and resource management in `ResultModal`. Added `useMemo` in `App.tsx` for prop stability.

## 4. Final State (Post-Phase 6)

*   The application features a functional results modal that appears automatically upon game completion.
*   The modal displays an accurate PNG preview of the game result (Layout v4, latest stage colors).
*   Users can successfully share the result image (where supported via `navigator.share`) or copy it to their clipboard (`navigator.clipboard.write`).
*   The implementation handles loading states, errors, and resource cleanup.
*   Known bugs related to canvas dimensions and React effect loops have been resolved.

## 5. Key Decisions & Learnings

*   **Modal Preview Decision:** Opted for a modal preview (vs. direct share button) to improve user experience by showing the output first, despite increased complexity.
*   **Iterative Layout/Content:** The desired PNG content and layout evolved during discussion (v1 -> v4), requiring adjustments to the rendering logic.
*   **Download vs. Copy:** Replaced Download with Copy functionality based on perceived user need/platform conventions.
*   **Color Logic:** Decided on "Latest Stage" priority for coloring intersecting cells after discussion.
*   **Debugging Challenges:**
    *   Diagnosed and fixed critical `0x0` canvas dimension bug caused by misuse of `getBoundingClientRect` on an offscreen element.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed `useEffect` infinite loop caused by incorrect dependency array in `ResultModal`.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed modal re-opening bug caused by incorrect effect trigger logic in `App.tsx`.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed cell color regression caused by incorrect map key formatting.
*   **Key Learnings:** Importance of verifying dimensions set on canvas elements; careful management of `useEffect` dependencies is critical to avoid loops; robust resource cleanup (Object URLs) is necessary; understanding browser API inconsistencies (`navigator.share`) is important.

## 6. Next Steps

With the core Share/Copy feature functionally complete, the next steps include:

1.  Performing final, thorough End-to-End testing (Step 6.11) across different browsers and devices.
2.  Addressing any critical bugs found during testing.
3.  Planning for Phase 7, which could include:
    *   Styling refinements for the generated PNG image.
    *   Implementing other planned features.
    *   Potentially beginning to address technical debt (e.g., introducing basic testing or error monitoring, investigating `CrosswordCore`).
